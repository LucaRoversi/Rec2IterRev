Source code companion of the work 
A. B. Matos, L. Paolini, and L. Roversi. "Splitting recursion schemes into reversible and classical interacting threads." Proceedings of Reversible Computation (RC 2021, July 7â€“8, 2021), vol.12805 of LNCS, pag.204-213 (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-79837-6). 
It is a preliminary compilation scheme of a limited class of recursive functions to pairs of reversible and classical iterative procedures. The procedures synchronously cooperate under a Producer/Consumer pattern, implementing the original recursive function.
